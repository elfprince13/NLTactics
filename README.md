NetLogo Tactical MDP Demo
=========================
This repository represents the final results of a class project for Michael Littman's [CSCI2951-F: Learning and Sequential Decision Making](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci2951-f/) at Brown University.

The goal of the project was to reimplement the results of Guestrin, et. al [1,2], using the [Brown-UMBC Reinforcement Learning and Planning](http://burlap.cs.brown.edu/) (BURLAP) library.
A secondary goal was to provide a framework for [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) programmers to leverage BURLAP within their own agent-based simulation environments.

A partial writeup is present in `results/RMDP.pdf`.
